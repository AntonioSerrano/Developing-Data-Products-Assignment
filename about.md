## Famous random distributions visualizer
###### By Antonio Serrano, August 2016

 

This Shiny App draws random samples from 10 different famous probability distributions and plots the samples using base R functions. Specifically, it includes:

* Discrete distributions:
    + Binomial
    + Poisson
    + Geometric
 
* Continuous distributions:
    + Uniform
    + Normal
    + Log-normal
    + Exponential
    + Gamma
    + Chi-square
    + F

You can select the sample size from 1 to 10,000 observations. Likewise, the parameters to be entered change according to the chosen distribution. You can modify those parameters as desired considering their space limitations.

Moreover, you can visualize their histograms, summary statistics and raw data generated.

Finally, both graphics and raw data from the random distributions can be downloaded by pressing the "Download Graphic" and "Download Sample" buttons respectively.
